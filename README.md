## 🔥 About Me

Hey! I'm **Himesh Fegade**, an indie game developer and 3D artist. I love creating worlds, crafting combat systems, designing levels, and breathing life into characters through animation and modeling.

This repo is my dev playground — a collection of games, experiments, 3D models, concepts, and systems I’ve been working on. You'll find polished builds, raw WIPs, and a whole lot of chaos that I absolutely love building.
